              Measure flour into a mixing bowl. Dissolve 2 teaspoons sugar and
              salt in warm milk. Blend into flour along with yeast and oil. Mix
              well; knead until smooth. Cover, and let rise until over triple in
              volume, about 3 hours. Deflate gently, and let rise again until
              doubled, about another 3 hours. Deflate and chill 20 minutes.

              Massage butter until pliable, but not soft and oily. Pat dough
              into a 14x8-inch rectangle. Smear butter over top two thirds,
              leaving 1/4-inch margin all around. Fold unbuttered third over
              middle third, and buttered top third down over that. Turn 90
              degrees, so that folds are to left and right. Roll out to a
              14x6-inch rectangle. Fold in three again. Sprinkle lightly with
              flour, and put dough in a plastic bag. Refrigerate 2 hours.
              Unwrap, sprinkle with flour, and deflate gently. Roll to a
              14x6-inch rectangle, and fold again. Turn 90 degrees, and repeat.
              Wrap, and chill 2 hours.

              To shape, roll dough out to a 20x5-inch rectangle. Cut in half
              crosswise, and chill half while shaping the other half. Roll out
              to a 15 x 5 inch rectangle. Cut into three 5 x 5 inch squares. Cut
              each square in half diagonally. Roll each triangle lightly to
              elongate the point, and make it 7 inches long. Grab the other 2
              points, and stretch them out slightly as you roll it up. Place on
              a baking sheet, curving slightly. Let shaped croissants rise until
              puffy and light. In a small bowl, beat together egg and 1
              tablespoon water. Glaze croissants with egg wash.
